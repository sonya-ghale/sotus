Proxying means putting my server at the middle for fetching information/data
my browser-> my server -> mangaDex Api

Limitation
http request rules
  User-Agent header must exist and be real
     Every request must include a User-Agent header.
     It cannot be “fake” or empty. Basically, the server wants to know who is making the request.
  No Via header allowed
     Via headers usually indicate a proxy server.
     MangaDex does not allow non-transparent proxies. If your request goes through a proxy that adds this header, it will be blocked.

     Anti-abuse policies

CORS restriction
Hotlink protection for images

I like
...mangaData( like this spread Operator)
and destructuring with rest

can only use use:enhance only in form POST 

in animate card_container
translate(-50%, calc(-40% + {...})) → keeps your original centered position logic.
Math.max(-scrollY / 8, -120) → moves up smoothly as you scroll, but stops after -120px.
/8 controls speed — smaller divisor → faster movement.
-120 controls limit — higher means it moves further upward before stopping.


style="transform:
 translate(-50%, calc(-40% + {Math.max(-scrollY / 3, -120)}px));"
