Proxying means putting my server at the middle for fetching information/data
my browser-> my server -> mangaDex Api

Limitation
http request rules
  User-Agent header must exist and be real
     Every request must include a User-Agent header.
     It cannot be “fake” or empty. Basically, the server wants to know who is making the request.
  No Via header allowed
     Via headers usually indicate a proxy server.
     MangaDex does not allow non-transparent proxies. If your request goes through a proxy that adds this header, it will be blocked.
